## Time Travel Project

I am learning how to use Git and GitHub to manage my software projects.


### .gitignore

I ignored `node_modules/` and `*.log` because these files are generated automatically and don't need to be tracked in Git.


### Branch Roles

- **author/idea-sprint:** Used for brainstorming and adding new creative content to the zine. This branch represents the Author’s perspective during idea development.
- **editor/review:** Used for reviewing, editing, and improving the Author’s work before merging into main. This branch represents the Editor’s role in refining the publication.
