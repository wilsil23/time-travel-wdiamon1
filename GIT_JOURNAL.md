# Git Journal

During this lab, I learned how to manage branches, issues, and pull requests in Git.  
I initially forgot to create separate branches before editing files, causing merge conflicts.  
Using `git merge --abort` and resolving conflicts in VS Code saved the day!  
I now feel more confident in using Git for real team projects.
